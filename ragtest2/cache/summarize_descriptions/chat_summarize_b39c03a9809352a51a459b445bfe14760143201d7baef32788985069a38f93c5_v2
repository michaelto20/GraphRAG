The Ghost serves as a guide, leading Scrooge through various scenes that illustrate the importance of compassion and the true spirit of Christmas.\n\nThroughout the narrative, the Ghost reveals visions of Scrooge's past, present, and future, each designed to impart crucial lessons about life and love.
