Scrooge is dismissive of the clerk's expressions of Christmas spirit, even going so far as to threaten his job for such displays. However, Scrooge later reflects on his behavior and begins to regret his treatment of the clerk. He recalls the kindness and generosity shown by his former employer, Fezziwig, toward his apprentices, and wishes he could emulate that same compassion and goodwill in his own actions.
