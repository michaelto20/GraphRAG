In one context, it is described as a secluded area behind a screen of rags in Old Joe's shop, serving as a gathering place for a group.

In another context, the parlour is depicted as a room within a house where a family comes together to open Christmas presents and share joy. This version of the parlour is warm, inviting, and associated with familial bonding and festive celebrations.\n\nDespite the differing descriptions, the term \"PARLOUR\" consistently represents a space where people convene, whether for somber purposes or joyous occasions.
