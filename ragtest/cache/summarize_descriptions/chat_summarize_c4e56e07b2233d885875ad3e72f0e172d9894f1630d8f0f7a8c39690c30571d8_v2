Marley, who passed away seven years ago, is a significant figure in Scrooge's past, symbolizing his former life and attitudes. Despite his death, Marley continues to have a profound influence on Scrooge. His memory haunts Scrooge, with his face frequently dominating Scrooge's thoughts. This supernatural connection is further emphasized when Marley's face appears on Scrooge's door knocker, serving as a chilling reminder of their bond and the lingering impact of their shared history.
