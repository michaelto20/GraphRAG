Initially portrayed as a miserly, cold-hearted, and solitary man, Scrooge is a wealthy businessman who works in a counting-house and lives alone in a gloomy set of chambers. He is described as secretive, self-contained, and indifferent to others, with a disdain for Christmas and human sympathy. Known for his grumpy demeanor and tight-fisted nature, Scrooge prioritizes his own affairs over others, refuses to contribute to charitable causes, and keeps a tight grip on resources, including coal for heating. He is the surviving partner of the firm Scrooge and Marley's and is often referred to as the \"\"Ogre of the family\"\" by the Cratchits due to his stingy and unfeeling behavior.\n\nDespite his initial portrayal, Scrooge undergoes a profound transformation over the course of the story. This change is catalyzed by a series of supernatural encounters with spirits who guide him through reflections on his past, present, and future. These spirits include the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come, as well as the Phantom. Through these encounters, Scrooge observes various scenes of Christmas celebrations and desolation, reflecting on his own life and choices. He revisits his childhood and apprenticeship, experiencing a mix of emotions such as joy, regret, and sorrow. He also reflects on his past relationships, particularly his pursuit of wealth over love and happiness, and is horrified by the potential consequences of his actions.\n\nScrooge is deeply moved by the love and struggles of the Cratchit family, especially the condition of Tiny Tim, whose life hangs in the balance. Witnessing these events, Scrooge pleads with the Spirit to spare Tiny Tim's life and begins to recognize the importance of generosity, compassion, and human connection. His journey culminates in a moral awakening, as he resolves to live a better and more generous life.\n\nBy the end of the narrative, Scrooge is a reformed man, filled with generosity and goodwill. He becomes kind and caring, helping Bob Cratchit and becoming a second father to Tiny Tim. His transformation is marked by a newfound appreciation for Christmas and a commitment to spreading joy and kindness.
