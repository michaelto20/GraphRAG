The phenomenon first occurs when Scrooge perceives Marley's face on the door knocker of his home, an eerie and unsettling prelude to the ghost's full appearance. Later, Marley's ghost visits Scrooge in person, delivering a dire warning about the consequences of his selfish and miserly lifestyle. During this visitation, Marley informs Scrooge of his own eternal torment, a punishment for his greed and lack of compassion during his lifetime. He cautions Scrooge that he is headed toward a similar fate unless he changes his ways. Marley's ghost also foretells the arrival of three spirits—the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come—who will guide Scrooge on a transformative journey to confront his actions and their impact on others.
